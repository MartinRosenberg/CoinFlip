# CoinFlip

A coin flip guessing game written in pure FP Scala with Cats Effect, based on ["A Functional Game (With a Little Bit of State)"](https://alvinalexander.com/scala/fp-book/functional-game-with-a-little-state) by [Alvin Alexander](https://alvinalexander.com/). I later discovered he'd written his own [Cats IO version](https://github.com/alvinj/CoinFlipGameWithCatsIO), though he didn't follow all the way through on it.

## To do

- [ ] Testing
